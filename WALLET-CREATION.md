# Private local creation snapshot

`account_create_hd` now accepts only `name` and `enabledPools`, plus the existing
owned seed parameter. It derives its birthday from a completed local snapshot
inside the same transaction that allocates the account. Import operations retain
their explicit birthday input. This does not provide a public memory signer.

Explicit sync first calls `scan_plan`, then completes through
`sync_call(generation, "scan_complete", {revision, target, treeState})`.
The native JSON uses protocol-order lowercase hex for `target.hash` and hex for
the canonical encoded TreeState; the JS facade accepts TreeState bytes. Completion
checks the current target/revision, native coverage, network and pool frontiers.
For scanned wallets, frontier roots must match native target checkpoints.

The single `ext_wallet_creation_snapshot` row persists the pending target and
completed TreeState. Opening an older DB creates an empty row, never a completed
snapshot. A newer target, scan ingestion or rewind invalidates completion;
historical targets cannot supersede a newer known target. New-account creation
returns `SYNC_REQUIRED` before allocation when state is unavailable or stale.

Host integration must pin the source target before recording completion. No
network operation occurs in the native creation path. Package schema/profile
pins and real Node/OPFS qualification must be updated before distributing this
changed private ABI; the previous runtime package remains a separate candidate.
