# Private viewing account/address candidate

This is real backend code on the existing worker-local WalletDb, not a public WalletClient or root SDK factory. Acceptance is pending independent HIGH review and final storage/host integration. The base is `dbd67c0`; its lifecycle, VFS, adapter and existing builders remain unchanged in this worktree apart from the authorized `mod accounts;` declaration.

## Required parent integration

`tests/wallet-views-storage-hook.patch` proposes one call to `accounts::initialize(conn)?` after native migrations on the same owned connection. The parent owns this lifecycle edit. It is **not applied to src/wallet.rs here**. The hook atomically installs and validates the exact version-1 `ext_viewing_*` schema. Account imports atomically retain original viewing containers and birthday protobufs alongside native records; native import alone discards supplied checkpoint frontiers on this pinned graph. A future scan implementation must load this retained checkpoint as its prior state. This slice does not implement scanning or claim native shard caches were populated by import.

Without that hook, account import fails closed when extension storage is missing. For review only, `build-views.py OUTPUT --proposed-parent-hook` applies the tracked patch in a fresh scratch source snapshot and records both original Git and actual patched input inventories, patch digest, tool/dependency hashes, commands, logs, and the resulting complete executable closure. A successful build receipt is not parent approval or production acceptance. The unmodified `build-wallet.py` verifier and approved generator/tool paths are reused; no generated glue or dependency source is patched.

## Private interface

```js
const owner = await initializeViews(wasmBytes, actualWorkerBackend,
  'zcash-js-network/1', parameterBytes, genesisBytes);
const account = owner.call(owner.generation, owner.instance, 'account_import', {
  viewingKey: applicationUfvk,
  birthday: {
    parameters: parameterBytes, genesis: genesisBytes,
    firstScanHeight, priorTreeState: pinnedTreeStateProtobufBytes,
    source: 'checkpoint', recoverUntilExclusive,
  },
});
const address = owner.call(owner.generation, owner.instance, 'address_next', {
  accountId: account.id,
});
owner.close(owner.generation, owner.instance);
```

The owner privately retains the one actual `initializeStorage` result, and imports the same `bindings.js`. No caller wallet handle, mutable wallet-state copy, duplicate WASM instance, signer registry or fake JS database is admitted. Every call uses the actual storage generation/instance guard before the native method. Native borrow/lifecycle guards repeat generation checks. A trapped owner is invalidated and must be destroyed; close failures retain ownership according to the inherited storage policy.

`call` supports `account_import`, `account_list`, `account_get`, `address_current`, `address_next`, `address_list`, and `address_at`. Argument fields follow the frozen account/address subset, with this private birthday lowering replacing the public Network object by exact registered parameter/genesis bytes. `birthday: 'fullScan'` explicitly starts at block 1 with the registered genesis and empty pre-scan trees, without a recovery boundary. Imports never silently substitute the current tip. Indices are exactly 88-bit bigint in JS; the internal JSON lowering uses canonical decimal strings. Returned records contain fresh bigint indices. No mnemonic, account-create, signer, recovery runner, send, proving or PCZT API exists.

The caller may supply an actual worker-local AbortSignal in `args.signal`. Pre-call abort reports `ABORTED` with `commit: none`; an abort observed after a successful native write reports `commit: committed`. A synchronous WASM call cannot process a second worker message while running. The tests exercise an abort at a real storage callback; they do not establish cross-worker interrupt/preemption or operation-ID recovery after a lost reply.

## Native policy and durable state

- Native UUIDs identify accounts across reopen; no list positions or account indices are identifiers. UFVK import defaults to spending-purpose tracking with no secret or signer. True view-only persists native tracking policy. UIVK wallet import rejects. A later signer could not implicitly upgrade this policy; no signer API is present.
- Enabled pools default to all three and require actual transparent/Sapling/Orchard-encoded Ironwood key components and configured activation heights. Subset projection uses the actual upstream UFVK container codec and preserves the original separately. Any overlapping registered component rejects before upstream's capability-upgrade import path. Unknown components reject.
- A projection containing only transparent authority cannot be represented as a valid UFVK by this backend and rejects `UNSUPPORTED_POOL_PROJECTION`. Transparent **addresses** from shielded-capable accounts are supported. This limit is not a fabricated transparent-only account path.
- Birthday bytes are decoded with pinned upstream prost TreeState, including separate legacy Orchard and Ironwood fields. Canonical protobuf and native tree reserialization reject ignored/unknown/duplicate/trailing data. Network, exact prior height, genesis at height zero, recovery boundary, complete active frontiers and empty pre-activation trees are checked. Same-height retained checkpoints must agree in hash and all frontiers. This validates supplied checkpoint coherence, not provider authenticity or proof of chain ancestry; the enclosing host authenticates network/checkpoint registration.
- `next` and exact-index `at` validate and commit native exposure before returning. Reads regenerate stored receivers against the actual registered key and index. `current` does not allocate and rechecks actual receiver requirements rather than trusting cached flags alone. Transparent-only exposure is retained in an extension record and verified against native external-scope exposure/derivation; its current value is the most recent explicitly recorded transparent-only exposure.
- Transparent allocations respect the native default discovery gap, using the real transactional gap query. Imports whose mandatory native default UA would fall beyond that gap reject before mutation. Exact-index requests never search or fall back; index reuse with different receivers rejects. No new discovery-range policy is invented.
- This account/address subset does not scan, spend or route legacy Orchard. Historical authority in an Orchard-encoded component is not a deployed Ironwood activation claim. Synthetic regtest heights in tests are not deployed network parameters.

## Qualification and retained limitations

Native tests use actual SQLite/WalletDb transactions and synthetic upstream-derived keys/tree vectors. Real WASM is built with offline locked Cargo and the approved wasm-bindgen 0.2.128 executable. Node tests use actual filesystem storage in destroyed/reopened workers, including write/commit/entropy failures and pre/post abort checks. Browser tests run an ordinary page module and dedicated-worker OPFS; the Firefox runner requires observed BiDi worker destruction before reopening. The coordinator must run it if this worker's loopback socket is denied, with unchanged browser security policy.

The producer source graph remains the base's Common 1.0.0 package family, `zakura-client-{backend,sqlite} 0.1.0-rc4`, and `zcash_protocol 0.10.6`; it does not substitute a distinct upstream `zcash_client_sqlite 0.18.12` package or Common 1.1.0. Exact archive/source inventories, inherited provenance and package versions are in the receipt. No package was installed or fetched. Fixture authority is **synthetic, never for production funds**; no user secret is included.

Inherited Common advisories remain open. Existing delivery evidence reports `RUSTSEC-2023-0089` (`atomic-polyfill@1.0.3`) coalesced across six qualification records; this work performs no new advisory scan and makes no clean-security claim. Encryption at rest, real browser quota exhaustion/eviction, power loss, full H1 negotiation/error/recovery envelopes, verified public loader integration, and final storage/host acceptance remain separate gates. No publication, push or merge is performed.
